    <h1>Yamini Reddy Pesaru does chekov tonight</h1>
    <h6>Anton Chekov UNCLE VANYA</h6>
    <h6 class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
    <p class ="speech">I am a little tired.</p>
    <h6 class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
-   <p  class="speech">They are going to Kharkoff to live.</p>
    <h6 class ="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
    <p class ="speech">They do well to go.</p>
    <h6 class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
    <p class="speech">They have been frightened. The professor's wife won't stay here
an hour longer. "If we are going at all, let's be off," says she, "we
shall go to Kharkoff and look about us, and then we can send for our
things." They are travelling light. It seems, Marina, that fate has
decreed for them not to live here.</p>
    <h6 class ="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
    <p class="speech">And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was
shameful!</p>
    <h6 class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
    <p class="speech">It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.</p>
    <h6 class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
    <p class="speech">I wish I'd never laid eyes on them. [A pause] Now we shall have
things as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in
the evening; everything in order as decent folks, as Christians like to
have it. [Sighs] It is a long time since I have eaten noodles.</p>
    <h6 class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. [A pause] Not for ages.
As I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the
shop-keepers called after me, "Hi! you hanger-on!" I felt it bitterly.</p>

MARINA. Don't pay the least attention to them, master; we are all
dependents on God. You and Sonia and all of us. Every one must work, no
one can sit idle. Where is Sonia?<br>

TELEGIN. In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he
may lay violent hands on himself.<br>

MARINA. Where is his pistol?<br>

TELEGIN. [Whispers] I hid it in the cellar.<br>

VOITSKI. Leave me alone! [To MARINA and TELEGIN] Go away! Go away and
leave me to myself, if but for an hour. I won't have you watching me
like this!<br>

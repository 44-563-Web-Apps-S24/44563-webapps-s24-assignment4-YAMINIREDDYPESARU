 <h1>Yamini Reddy Pesaru does Chekov tonight</h1>

 <div class="speech">
     <h6 Class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>

<p>[With determination] I must ask you never to talk to me about
it! You know that when Nicolai Mihailovitch died, life lost all its
meaning for me. I vowed never to the end of my days to cease to wear
mourning, or to see the light.... You hear? Let his ghost see how well I
love him.... Yes, I know it's no secret to you that he was often unfair
to me, cruel, and... and even unfaithful, but I shall be true till
death, and show him how I can love. There, beyond the grave, he will see
me as I was before his death....</p>

<p>Instead of talking like that you ought to go and have a walk in
the garden, or else order Toby or Giant to be harnessed, and then drive
out to see some of the neighbours.</p>

 <p> Oh! [Weeps.]</p>

<p>Madam! Dear madam! What is it? Bless you!</p>

<p>He was so fond of Toby! He always used to ride on him to the
Korchagins and Vlasovs. How well he could ride! What grace there was
in his figure when he pulled at the reins with all his strength! Do you
remember? Toby, Toby! Tell them to give him an extra feed of oats.</p>
</div>
<div class="direction">
 <h6 Class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>

<p>Yes, madam. [A bell rings noisily.]</p>
</div>
<div class="speech">
 <h6 Class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>

<p>[Shaking] Who's that? Tell them that I receive nobody.</p>
</div>
<div class="direction">
 <h6 Class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>

<p>Yes, madam. [Exit.]</p>
</div>

<p>[Looks at the photograph] You will see, Nicolas, how I can love
and forgive.... My love will die out with me, only when this poor heart
will cease to beat. [Laughs through her tears] And aren't you ashamed?
I am a good and virtuous little wife. I've locked myself in, and will
be true to you till the grave, and you... aren't you ashamed, you bad
child? You deceived me, had rows with me, left me alone for weeks on
end....</p>

 <p>[LUKA enters in consternation.]</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
 <h6 Class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
 <p>Madam, somebody is asking for you. He wants to see you....</p>
</div>

<div class="speech">
 <h6 Class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
 <p>But didn't you tell him that since the death of my husband I've stopped receiving?</p>
</div>

<div class="direction">
 <h6 Class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
 <p>I did, but he wouldn't even listen; says that it's a very pressing affair.</p>
</div>


<div class="speech">
 <h6 Class="name Marina">Marina.</h6>
 <p>I do not receive!</p>
</div>

<div class="direction">
 <h6 Class="name Telegin">Telegin.</h6>
 <p>I told him so, but the... the devil... curses and pushes himself 
 right in.... He's in the dining-room now.</p>
